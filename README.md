# **AI.SCARA** â€“ Open-source low-cost SCARA robot 
## Abstract
The aim of this project was to design and build a low-cost robot based on the industrial concept SCARA, which meets the requirements in terms of rigidity and repeatability for application in a wide range of manipulation tasks primarily implemented in a university environment. The project includes not only the mechanical design, but also design and implementation of the electrical circuitry, control system, and design of a human-machine graphical interface for basic controland diagnosis of the robotic structure.
